# I love Petri nets Angular components library

This project contains an Angular library containing components, services and other classes that can be used and re-used in order to create new modules for the "I love Petri nets" website.

This project is not meant to be used as a standalone project, as it contains only the library source code.
[The Module project](https://github.com/ILPN/ILPN-Module), should be used to develop new modules and make changes to this project via git-submodules.
The library is NOT published to NPM and is built and linked locally.

If you encounter a problem with the library, or have some ideas for improvements. Feel free to create a new issue and/or open a pull request.

An overview of notable changes across library versions can be found in [the changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).
