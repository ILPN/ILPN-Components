[//]: # (## Unreleased)

## 1.2.0 - 2023-04-11
### Added
- Petri net regions / Token trails algorithms implemented
  - `TokenTrailIlpSolver` contains common implementations of ILP constraints for the Token trail semantics
  - `TokenTrailValidator` builds upon this solver, to decide the net language inclusion problem
  - `IncrementalMiner` allows interactive mining of a Petri net in incremental steps 
    - Instances should be created via the `IncrementalMinerFactoryService`
    - A single instance can operate on a single set of specifications at the same time
      - intermediary results are cached
      - A new set of specifications can be supplied to the miner, clearing the previous cached results
- `IlpnAlgorithmsModule`
  - contains the definitions of most services that deal with ILPs
  - `ILPN_DEBUG_CONFIG` injection token was added, that can configure debugging options of the algorithms contained in the module
- A `MapArray<K,V>` utility class, representing a `Map<K,Array<V>>` has been added
- `ExternalRedirectHookGuard` has been added, to allow bypassing Angular router when redirecting to relative URLs that are not handled by an Angular single-page application
  

### Changed
- `FileUploadComponent`
  - file upload dialog now opens on click
  - cursor changes on hover to indicate, that the component can be clicked
- `ArcWeightIlpSolver` - source file name changed to kebab-case
- `glpk.js`
  - services that use the `glpk.js` solver, now accept configuration objects that configure the message level of the solver
  - types and interfaces used by this library to create inputs and outputs for the solver are now exported
- `PnDisplayComponent` rewrite
  - Petri net related classes now contain no information related to their layout (eg. X and Y coordinates)
  - A new set of wrapper classes (`SvgPetriNet`, `SvgPlace`, `SvgTransition` ...) has been added to hold this information
  - The SVG Places can react to user inputs (such as click events) and the display component emits these events
  - The SVG Places can be filled with a specified color passed via the display component
  - Markings with less than 10 tokens are now displayed as black dots inside the places
- `LogToPartialOrderTransformerService` the resulting partial order nets now contain tokens in the places, that correspond to the initial state
- `RegionIlpSolver`, `RegionSynthesiser` & `Region`
  - `Region` classes have been renamed to `PetriNetRegion` 
  - The region solver now accepts multiple nets as inputs
    - It is no longer necessary to merge multiple net instances into a single net
  - the `PetriNetRegion` now contains information about the input nets, the markings of these nets that are the region, rises of all labels and an index into the nets, where the initial state can be read
- `RegionsConfiguration` - `oneBoundRegions` was changed to `noArcWeights`. This change is equivalent for most intents and purposes
- `PnLayoutingService` - Sugiyama remove cycles method has been made more consistent

### Removed
- `PnRendererService` used to create SVG Element objects for displaying Petri nets. This functionality is now contained in the new SVG wrapper classes
- `NetUnionResult` has been removed
  - The `PetriNet.netUnion()` static method now returns a `PetriNet` instance instead. Place ids of the second argument net, can be prefixed, to distinguish the two nets in the result
- `PetriNetRegionTransformerService` has been removed
  - The `applyMarking` method in `PetriNet` and the new `PetriNetRegion` representation can be used to achieve similar results

## 1.1.0 - 2022-12-16
### Added
- Changelog was added to the project
- `BranchingProcessFoldingService` has been added to the project
  - It can fold multiple partial orders represented as Petri nets into a single branching process Petri net structure in a simplistic way
- `DuplicatePlaceRemoverService` has been added to the project
  - It removes places from a Petri net, if the net already contains a place with the same pre-/post-set
  - It does NOT consider marking of the places
- An `equals` method has been added to the `Trace` class
- New methods have been added to the `PetriNet` class that allow getting of the in- and out-put places as Arrays instead of Sets
- `DirectlyFollowsExtractor` has been added to the project
  - It consumes a set of follows pairs and can then return only those pairs that directly follow each other in only one direction
- `ArcWeightIlpSolver` has been added to the project
  - It adds utility for building integer linear programms that contain in- and out-going arc weights of Petri net transitions as variables
- A simple implementation of the ILP miner algorithm has been added to the project
  - The miner is made available via the `IlpMinerService`
  - The solver that constructs and solves the integer linear program is implemented in the `IlpMinerIlpSolver` class
- An implementation of the ILPÂ² miner algorithm has been added to the project
  - The miner is made available via the `Ilp2MinerService`
  - The solver that constructs and solves the integer linear program is implemented in the `Ilp2MinerIlpSolver` class
- `IlpSolverService` has been added to the project
  - It makes an instance of the glpk ILP solver available for various algorithms
  - The `PetriNetRegionsService` has been updated to reflect this change
- `TraceMultisetEquivalentStateTraverser` has been added to the project
  - It allows the traversal and construction of a reachability graph, where every state is represented by the multiset of labels that were observed to reach the state


### Changed
- The `LogCleaner` abstract class has been removed in favour of simple functions
  - The `cleanLog` and `cleanTrace` function have been made available
  - The `AlphaOracleService`, `TimestampOracleService`, `AbelOracleService`, `LogToPartialOrderTransformerService` and `ImplicitPlaceRemoverService` have been updated to reflect this change
- The `START_SYMBOL` and `STOP_SYMBOL` public static constants have been removed from the `LogToPartialOrderTransformerService` and made available through a new `LogSymbol` enum
- The `PetriNetIsomorphismService` can now return an isomorphic mapping if it exists
- Refactored the `RegionIlpSolver` class
  - the methods that build generic ILP constraints have been extracted into a new abstract `IlpSolver` class
- The `InfoCardComponent` has been made wider and a small padding has been added to the bottom
- The `LogToPartialOrderTransformerService` has been made more time and space efficient (even thought there is still room for future improvements)


### Fixed
- fixed a bug in the `PartialOrderIsomorphismService` that prevented an event with multiple predecessors to be resolved correctly
